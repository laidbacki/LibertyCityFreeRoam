A freemode gamemode fully written from scratch.    
It's aiming for modularity by splitting parts of the gamemode into multiple independent resources.    
This allows you to remove parts at your will, add custom extensions without conflicting resources and even use single parts outside of the gamemode.

## Changelog    
All notable changes to this project will be documented [here](CHANGELOG.md).
